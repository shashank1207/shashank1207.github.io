                <p>We are a massive meth manufacturing and distributer based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, founded by former chemistry teacher Walter White and catalyzed by his former student Jesse Pinkman. We started our journey in 2009.
                Our meth empire was rooted from Walt's initial decision to begin cooking crystal meth with Jesse Pinkman after Walt was diagnosed with Stage III terminal lung cancer. Although the two began as amateur, small-time meth cooks, manufacturing the drug out of an RV in the deserts of New Mexico, and being met with very limited success, Walt and Jesse soon climbed up the drug hierarchy, killing or systematically destroying anyone who impeded them. </p>
